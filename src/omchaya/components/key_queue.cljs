  "Cribbed from https://gist.github.com/tomconnors/8460406 .  We
  should probably rewrite.

  The key function is KeyboardHandler, which takes a KEYMAP, a map
  from key combinations as descibed in event->key and match-keys to
  functions of no arguments.  This component sets up a loop which
  checks for key combinations in KEYMAP, calling the associated
  function when they happen.  Key sequences can be represented as
  strings, with consecutive key events separated by a space.  Keys in
  key combinations need to be pressed within one second, or the loop
  forgets about them."
